# Improving interactivity

- Utilize facial recognition to cache faces and information of speakers.
When a face is recognized upwards of 90%, a small circular profile photo of the person smoothly transitions
below the live player. When hovering over the face, it expands to show their title, name, and maybe a brief description of what they do. Potentially add social media credentials if they are available.
  * Note:
  Long term, there will have a be a team responsible for updating this data to make sure it is accurate and up-to-date, as guests will often want to make sure they are represented correctly and that representation could change. 
  
  To help resolve this, the data sent to the endpoint could be tied to the graphics operator's system so that as information is updated on the main page, the data showing on these pop outs are accurate. Shouldn't be too crazy. But we must make sure we are displaying the correct information.

- Utilize brand recognition for ads
When an ad is playing or a brand is shown on-screen, we can create a clickable link on the player or display more information on the side of the player to allow users to quickly click on the product being displayed and buy it.

- Enable story tracking
Give users the ability to subscribe to certain stories, keep track of live stories and articles and ping subscribed users when a story they are interested in has a new article out or if it's currently being covered on air. This could help cut down on spamming users with content they aren't interested in and ensure users are tuning in to stories relevant for them and improve engagement.
